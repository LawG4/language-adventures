# Language Adventures

This is where I'd like to explore any languages just for fun! Especially focusing on some weirder or newer languages. If I can trial as many different languages as possible, I can build up my understanding on what makes a language good. And then further potentially go onto design my own? Who knows 

A lot of languages will use CMake as a build system so we'll have a common CMake folder to drive this build and provide some common helper functions
