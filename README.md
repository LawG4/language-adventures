# Language Adventures

This is where I'd like to explore any languages just for fun! Especially focusing on some weirder or newer languages. If I can trial as many different languages as possible, I can build up my understanding on what makes a language good. And then further potentially go onto design my own? Who knows 

Here's a list of each of the samples I'll be trying to do for each language

| Sample Name      | Brief Description                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-hello-world   | Print out the standard "Hello world" message showing basic std output                         |
| 02-function      | Call a function from within the same file                                                     |
| 03-multfile      | Call a function from within the same compilation unit, but the sources are in different files |
| 04-simple-lib    | Call a function from a seperate compilation unit, either a dynamic or a static library        |
| 05-console-input | Handle recieving input from the user via the console                                          |
| 06-file-io       | Read a file local to the executable make some changes and then write it out                   |
| 07-libc-out      | Call into a library which was compiled from C source code                                     |
| 08-libc-in       | From C call into a function which was compiled within this language                           |

Special samples which can't be performed on all of the programming languages 

| Sample Name | Languages | Brief Description                      |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| S01-syscall |           | Ask the kernel directly for a function |
|             |           |                                        |
|             |           |                                        |
